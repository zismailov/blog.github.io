  <i>Ruby represents small integers using Fixnum<br/>
    and large integers using Bignum.</i>
</div>

Most of us don’t use Ruby to perform complex calculations for science,
engineering or cryptography applications; instead, we might turn to R, Matlab
or some other programming language or tool for that sort of thing. When we calculate
values using Ruby, it’s often to process simple values while generating a web
page using ERB or Haml, or to handle the result of a database query using
ActiveRecord. Almost all of the time, Ruby’s <span class="code">Fixnum</span>
class is more than sufficient.

For most Ruby developers, therefore, the <span class="code">Bignum</span> class is a dark, unfamiliar
corner of the language. Today I’d like to shed some light on <span class="code">Bignum</span> by looking
at how Ruby represents integers internally inside the <span class="code">Fixnum</span> and <span class="code">Bignum</span>
classes. What’s the largest integer that fits inside a <span
  class="code">Fixnum</span>; just how big is a <span
  class="code">Bignum</span>?

Also, it turns out that Ruby 2.1 contains an important new change for the
<span class="code">Bignum</span> class: support for the [GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)](https://gmplib.org) library.
In my next post, I’ll take a look at mathematical theory and history behind
some of the algorithms used by <span class="code">Bignum</span> internally and how Ruby 2.1 works
with GMP. But for now, let’s start with the basics.

## 64-Bit Integers 

Most computers these days represent numbers as 64 digit binary values
internally. For example, the number ten thousand looks like this expressed as a
binary value:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/64-bits.png"><br/>

My rectangle here represents how a 64-bit computer would save an integer in a
microprocessor register or a RAM memory location. The numbers 63 and 0 indicate
that there are spaces for 64 binary digits, each of which can contain a zero or
one. The most significant binary digit, #63, is on the left, while the least
significant digit, #0, is on the right. I’m not showing all of the leading
zeroes here to keep things simple.

The term _64-bit architecture_ means the logic gates, transistors and circuits
located on your microprocessor chip are designed to process binary values using
64 binary digits like this, in parallel. Whenever your code uses an integer,
the microprocessor retrieves all of these on/off values from one of the RAM
chips in your CPU using a “bus” or set of 64 parallel connections.

## 64-Bit Integers in MRI Ruby

The standard implementation of Ruby, Matz’s Ruby Interpreter (MRI), saves
integers using a slightly different, custom format; it hard codes the least
significant digit (on the right in my diagram) to one and shifts the actual
integer value one bit to the left. As we’ll see in a moment, if this bit were
zero Ruby would instead consider the integer to be a pointer to some Ruby
object.

Here’s how Ruby represents ten thousand
internally:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/64-bits-ruby.png"><br/>

<span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>=1 indicates this integer represents an instance of the <span class="code">Fixnum</span>
class. The flag is a performance optimization, removing the need for Ruby to
create a separate C structure the way it normally would for other types of
objects. (Ruby uses a similar trick for symbols and special values such as
<span class="code">true</span>, <span class="code">false</span> and <span class="code">nil</span>.)

## Two’s Complement in Ruby

Like most other computer languages and also like your microprocessor’s actual hardware
circuits, Ruby uses a binary format called [two’s complement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) to save negative
integers. Here’s how the value -10,000 would be saved inside your Ruby program:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/twos-complement-ruby.png"><br/>

Note the first bit on the left, the sign bit, is set to 1. This indicates this
is a negative integer. Ruby still sets the lowest bit, <span
  class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>, to 1. The other bits contain the value
itself. To calculate a two’s complement value for a negative integer, your
microprocessor adds one to the absolute value (getting 10,001 in this example)
and then reverses the zeroes and ones. This is equivalent to subtracting the
absolute value from the next highest power of two. Ruby uses two’s complement
in the same way, except it adds <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span> on the
right and shifts the rest of the value to the left.

## The Largest Fixnum Value: 4611686018427387903

Using 64-bit binary values with <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>, Ruby is able to take advantage of
your computer’s microprocessor to represent integer values efficiently. Addition,
subtraction and other integer operations can be handled using the
corresponding assembly language instructions by removing and then re-adding
<span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span> internally as needed. This design only
works, however, for integer values that are small enough to fit into a single
64-bit word. We can see what the largest positive <span
  class="code">Fixnum</span> integer must be by setting all 62 of the middle
bits to one, like this:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/largest-value.png"><br/>

Here we have a zero on the left (indicating this is a positive integer) and a
one on the right (for <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>). The remaining 62 bits in the middle hold
this binary number:<br/>
11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

Converting this to decimal we get: 4611686018427387903, the largest integer
that fits into a <span class="code">Fixnum</span> object. (If you compiled Ruby on a 32-bit computer, of
course, the largest <span class="code">Fixnum</span> would be much smaller than this, only 30-bits wide.)

## The Smallest Bignum: 4611686018427387904

But what does Ruby do if we want to use larger numbers? For example, this Ruby
program works just fine:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/code.png"><br/>

But now the sum doesn’t fit into a 64-bit <span class="code">Fixnum</span> value, since expressing
4611686018427387904 as a binary value requires 63 digits, not 62:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/doesnt-fit.png"><br/>

This is where the <span class="code">Bignum</span> class comes in. While calculating
4611686018427387903+1, Ruby has to create a new type of object to represent
4611686018427387904 - an instance of the <span class="code">Bignum</span> class. Here’s how that looks
inside of Ruby:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/pointer.png"><br/>

On the right you can see Ruby has reset the <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span> to zero, indicating
this value is not a <span class="code">Fixnum</span> but instead a pointer to some other type of object.
(C programs like MRI Ruby that use <span class="code">malloc</span> to allocate memory always get
addresses that end in zero, that are _aligned_. This means the <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>, a
zero, is actually also part of the pointer’s value.)

## The RBignum Structure

Now let’s take a closer look at the <span class="code">RBignum</span> C structure and find out what’s
inside it. Here’s how Ruby saves the value 4611686018427387904 internally: 

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/closer-look.png"><br/>

On the left, you can see <span class="code">RBignum</span> contains an inner structure called <span class="code">RBasic</span>,
which contains internal, technical values used by all Ruby objects. Below that
I show values specific to <span class="code">Bignum</span> objects: <span class="code">digits</span> and <span class="code">len</span>. <span class="code">digits</span> is a pointer
to an array of 32-bit values that contain the actual big integer’s bits grouped
into sets of 32. <span class="code">len</span> records how many 32-bit groups are in the <span class="code">digits</span> array.
Since there can be any number of groups in the <span class="code">digits</span> array, Ruby can represent
arbitrarily large integers using <span class="code">RBignum</span>.

Ruby divides up the bits of the big integer into 32-bit pieces. On the left,
the first 32-bit value contains the least significant 32 bits from the big
integer, bit 31 down to bit 0. Following that, the second value contains bits
63-32. If the big integer were larger, the third value would contain bits
95-64, etc. Therefore, the large integer’s bits are actually not in order: The
groups of bits are in reverse order, while the bits inside each group are in
the proper order.

To save a <span class="code">Bignum</span> value, Ruby starts by saving the
least significant bits of the target integer into the first 32-bit digit group.
Then it shifts the remaining bits 32 places to the right and saves the next 32
least significant bits into the next group. Ruby continues shifting and saving
until the entire big integer has been processed.

Ruby allocates enough 32-bit pieces in the <span class="code">digits</span> array to provide enough room
for the entire large integer. For example, for an extremely large number
requiring 320 bits, Ruby could use 10 32-bit values by setting <span class="code">len</span> to 10 and
allocating more memory:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/ten-digits.png"><br/>

In my example Ruby needs just two 32-bit values. This makes sense because, as
we saw above, 4611686018427387903 is a 62-bit integer (all ones) and when I add one I get a 63-bit value. When I add
one, Ruby first copies the 62 bits in the target value into a new <span class="code">Bignum</span> structure, like this:

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/copy-to-bignum.png"><br/>

Ruby copies the least significant 32 bits into the first digit
value on the left, and the most significant 30 into the second digit value on
the right (there is space for two leading zeroes in the second digit value).

Once Ruby has copied 4611686018427387903 into a new <span
  class="code">RBignum</span> structure, it can then use a special algorithm
implemented in bignum.c to perform an addition operation on the new Bignum. Now
there is enough room to hold the 63-bit result, 4611686018427387904 (diagram copied from above):

<img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2014/1/9/closer-look.png"><br/>

A few other minor details to learn about this:

<ul>
  <li>Ruby saves the sign bit inside the <span class="code">RBasic</span>
  structure, and not in the binary digit values themselves. This saves a bit of
  space, and makes the code inside bignum.c simpler.</li>

  <li>Ruby also doesn’t need to save the <span class="code">FIXNUM_FLAG</span>
  in the digits, since it already knows this is a <span
    class="code">Bignum</span> value and not a <span class="code">Fixnum</span>.</li>

  <li>For small <span class="code">Bignum</span>’s, Ruby saves memory and time
by storing the digits values right inside the <span class="code">RBignum</span> structure itself, using a
C <i>union</i> trick. I don’t have time to explain that here today, but you can see
how the same optimization works for strings in my article <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/1/4/never-create-ruby-strings-longer-than-23-characters">Never create Ruby strings longer than 23 characters</a>.</li>
</ul>

## Next time

In my next post I’ll look at how Ruby performs an actual mathematical operation
using <span class="code">Bignum</span> objects. It turns out there’s more to multiplication that you
might think: Ruby uses one of a few different multiplication algorithms
depending on how large the integers are, each with a different history behind
it. And Ruby 2.1 adds yet another new algorithm to the mix with GMP.

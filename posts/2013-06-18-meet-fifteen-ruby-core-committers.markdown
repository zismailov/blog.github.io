We all know Yukihiro Matsumoto invented Ruby, but how many of the other people
behind Ruby can you name? Judging from this photo taken just a few weeks ago at
[RubyKaigi 2013](http://rubykaigi.org/2013), the Ruby 2.0 release was a real
team effort, with commits both from the people on stage in Tokyo and hundreds
of other open source developers located around the world.

However, many of the most active developers behind the Ruby 2.0 release are
Japanese, largely unknown to the Ruby world outside of Japan because of the
language barrier. Recently I asked the Ruby 2.0 release manager, Yusuke Endoh,
to send a few questions to the Ruby 2.0 committers located in Japan. I was
curious who they were, what each of them worked on and what they’re like as
people. Fourteen other developers replied to his survey; read on to take a look
behind the language barrier and meet some of the people in Japan behind this
year’s Ruby 2.0 release.

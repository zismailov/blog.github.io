It was only last April when Laurent Sansonetti captured the imagination of the
entire Ruby community with [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/). For the first time Ruby
developers were able to write apps directly for the iOS mobile
platform using the language we all know and love. Now there is no
longer a need to learn the archaic, verbose Objective-C language, or
worse yet to learn to navigate the confusing myriad of windows and dialog boxes in
the XCode IDE. We can just bring the magic of Ruby to iOS, using our favorite
tools: VIM, Sublime or Emacs with our usual command line based workflow.

I was thrilled earlier this month when Laurent agreed to do an interview with
me for RubySource. I was able to learn more about RubyMotion directly from its
inventor. Since I had so many questions, I’ve divided the interview into two
halves. [In the first
half](http://rubysource.com/getting-to-know-rubymotion-with-laurent-sansonetti/),
I ask Laurent some basic questions: What is RubyMotion, exactly? What does it
do? How should we use it? Is writing Ruby for iOS any different from writing a
“normal” Ruby app?

[The second half of the
interview](http://rubysource.com/laurent-sansonetti-on-rubymotion-internals) is
a bit more technical: How does RubyMotion work, exactly? How does Laurent use
the LLVM framework to compile Ruby code into a static executable? How does it
differ from the way MacRuby and Rubinius work? I love learning about Ruby
internals, and RubyMotion is certainly a unique and fascinating implementation
of Ruby.

<b>Update:</b> I just setup an [email sign up form](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope) - if you give me your email address I'll send you one - count ’em - one email messsage when the eBook is finished.

You may have noticed I haven’t been blogging here for a while; instead I’ve been working on a new eBook about Ruby language internals. I find this topic fascinating! In fact many of my blog posts this year have been about how Ruby, JRuby and Rubinius actually work on the inside, “under the hood.” Instead of continuing to blog about it, I’ve decided to write an entire book which I plan to release this Fall. For now, I’m calling the book “<u>Ruby Under a Microscope - Learning Ruby Internals Through Experiment</u>.”

Today I’m excited to release a preview of one chapter of the eBook called “How Hashes Scale From One To One Million Elements.” Here’s a link to it:

<a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/Ruby-Under-a-Microscope-Rough-Draft-May.pdf"><img src="http://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2012/5/9/pdficon_large.png"/></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/Ruby-Under-a-Microscope-Rough-Draft-May.pdf">Ruby Under A Microscope</a>

I might release another chapter in the next couple of months, or at least some excerpts from the book as blog posts. Ultimately I might charge some money for the finished version. To hear when the book is finished and available, just follow me on Twitter and/or subscribe to my RSS feed.

It was a blast to write and I hope it will be a relatively quick, fun read for you. I realize it’s very long - at 41 pages you’ll probably have to put it on your “read-it-later” list. But if you’re interested in the topic of Ruby internals I’d love to know what you think about either the chapter’s writing style or content.
If you take the time to download and read it, here’s what you’ll find inside:

Many thanks a lot to everyone who read the “rough, rough draft” of this, and helped me refine my thinking and improve the text: Alex, Daniel, Rashmi, Peter, Mike, Jonathan and Amit.

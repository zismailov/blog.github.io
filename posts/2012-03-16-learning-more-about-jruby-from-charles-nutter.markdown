JRuby has been in the news a lot recently: just a couple of weeks ago [JRuby 1.6.7 was released](http://jruby.org/2012/02/22/jruby-1-6-7), [JRubyConf](http://jrubyconf.com/) is coming up soon, and over the past several months there’s been a lot of buzz about the upcoming JRuby 1.7 release and how it will take advantage of Java 7’s new support for “InvokeDynamic.” With all of this going on, I was thrilled to have a chance to interview [Charles Nuttter](http://twitter.com/headius), one of developers on the JRuby core team.

If you have a few minutes, read on to hear directly from Charles in his own words about what’s new in JRuby, why a traditional Rubyist would want to use JRuby, how Ruby apps can use Java libraries from a Maven repository, and - my favorite topic - JRuby internals. For me this was all fascinating! Interviewing Charles was a golden opportunity to learn more about JRuby.

I posted the interview over on [RubySource.com](http://rubysource.com/learning-more-about-jruby-from-charles-nutter/).DELIM

[Xavier Noria](https://twitter.com/fxn) (pronounced “sha - vee - aay “ in
Catalan) is very well known in the Ruby community. A self-employed Ruby
developer from Barcelona, he’s also a member of the Rails core team and won the
[Ruby Hero](http://rubyheroes.com) award during [RailsConf
2010](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010). Many of you may have met him in person;
he has presented at numerous Ruby conferences all across Europe this year.

But I’m most impressed by Xavier’s role as the “Code Gardener” - a phrase I
took from a [minor Rails commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fb6b80562041e8d2378cad1b51f8c234fe76fd5e)
he made over two years ago. You can read more about this commit in an [article
I wrote last year](http://patshaughnessy.net/2011/12/6/learning-from-the-masters-some-of-my-favorite-rails-commits)
about my favorite Rails commits. Last week Xavier and I had a chance to talk
for over an hour - [read the interview on
RubySource.com](http://rubysource.com/xavier-noria-the-code-gardener/) to learn
more about his background, what’s coming in Rails 4, his passion for
documentation and most importantly his philosophy about the importance of small
changes. I also got a chance to ask Xavier about how you can determine if a
number is prime using a regular expression!
